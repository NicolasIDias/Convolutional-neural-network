## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a CNN model to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. We use TensorFlow and Keras to train a deep neural network on a dataset of labeled images.

- **Technologies Used**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
- **Key Features**: Data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NicolasIDias/Convolutional-neural-network.git
    cd Convolutional-neural-network
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
